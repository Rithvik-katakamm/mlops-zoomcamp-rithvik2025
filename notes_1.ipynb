    "* [ ] What are the **success metrics** (business + ML)?\n",
    "* [ ] Does this problem actually require ML? Could rules or heuristics work?\n",
    "* [ ] Who are the stakeholders & end users?\n",

    "* [ ] **Sources**: Where is the data coming from? Internal DB, APIs, streaming?\n",
    "* [ ] **Quality**: Missing values, duplicates, noise.\n",
    "* [ ] **Volume & frequency**: How big is the data? How often is it updated?\n",
    "* [ ] **Compliance**: Any privacy, regulatory, or legal constraints?\n",

    "* [ ] What’s the **evaluation plan**? Metrics, validation strategy (e.g., k-fold, time split).\n",
    "* [ ] Experiment tracking in place? (MLflow, Weights & Biases)\n",

    "\n",
    "* [ ] Monitoring for **service health** (uptime, latency).\n",
    "* [ ] Monitoring for **model health** (data drift, concept drift, performance decay).\n",
    "* [ ] Alerts & dashboards in place?\n",

    "If you walk into any ML project meeting and can talk through these **seven buckets**, you instantly sound like the person who sees the *whole chessboard* — which is exactly what MLOps Zoomcamp is training you for.\n"
